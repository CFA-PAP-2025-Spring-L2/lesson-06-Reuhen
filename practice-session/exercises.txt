Animal Aristocracy Revisited

Exercise 1
1. In index.html:
Add 3 more animal aristocrat images

Exercise 2
1. In index.html:
Under each image add: 
h3 with text - name of aristocrat
p with text - description one silly sentence about the animal or lorem ipsum 

Exercise 3
1. Wrap a div tag around each group of img, h3, and p, (so that the picture, heading, and description for each aristocrat is contained in a div)

Exercise 4
1. In style.css, select all the div tags by tag tagname
Set display so the divs line up next to each other 
Set the width of the divs around 300px - 375px
Set padding
Set margin
Set background-color

Exercise 5
1. In style.css, edit the styles for the images
Keep the images from overlapping or spilling outside the divs
You will need to do some simple math
Remove the left and right margins on the images 
Instead, create space around them by adjusting padding set on the divs
Remove the height setting from the images
Calculate a new width for images so they fit inside the width of the divs, remember to account for padding and border

Exercise 6
1. In index.html, wrap a main tag around the divs
2. In style.css, set max-width on the main tag so only 3 divs fit per row at the largest screen sizes and center it with margin auto
